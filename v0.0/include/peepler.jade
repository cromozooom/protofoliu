						br
						| The basic element of this project is espionage. In practice, you can see information about an email address that you are interested.

						| The concept is very similar to the practice of looking through the keyhole. The whole system is based on results of searches inside APIs applications.
						| The symbol represents the intersection of elements: searching lens & the keyhole.
